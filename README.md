# datetime-finder-js
A date-time finder in JavaScript (**in progress**).

To install dependencies
```
npm install
```
To test (with karma)
```
npm test
```

##TODO
- time regex
- generic highlighting mechanism (the user can decide which highlighting function to use)
- refactor code to look more like a lib
- ignore invalid dates like '111-111-111' or '28-08/1988'
